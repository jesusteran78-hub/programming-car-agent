_ by Michael Hyde

FIAT = ALFA ROMEO

DISCLAIMER:

A wide variety of key programmers have been added to this book. Most key programmer companies are
not based in the U.S. Some of their application charts have many mistakes. In some cases, you will need
to check with your key programmer supplier to see if the vehicle you are working on is supported by their
tool. There is always a risk in damaging the vehicle electronics when you connect to the vehicle through
the OBD port if you are not using an OEM diagnostic tool. You as the locksmith take on this risk every
time you perform work on a vehicle.

If you have any doubt about what part to use, make sure you check with the dealer and have them run
the VIN to get you the right part number. Remember, ultimately it is your responsibility to obtain the
correct part. Part numbers and FCC information has been researched and verified as best as possible.
But no system is perfect or without errors. Car manufacturers’ part numbers and applications guides
contain mistakes of their own. Therefore, we cannot guarantee or warranty that the part we show for a
particular vehicle is the absolute right one.
