NISSAN = INFINITI

DISCLAIMER: : : : :
A wide variety of key programmers have been added to this book. Most key programmer companies are
not based in the U.S. Some of their application charts have many mistakes. In some cases, you will need
to check with your key programmer supplier to see if the vehicle you are working on is supported by their

tool. There is always a risk in damaging the vehicle electronics when you connect to the vehicle through
| the OBD port if you are not using an OEM diagnostic tool. You as the locksmith take on this risk every

time you perform work on a vehicle.

If you have any doubt about what part to use, make sure you check with the dealer and have them run
the VIN to get you the right part number. Remember, ultimately it is your responsibility to obtain the
correct part. Part numbers and FCC information has been researched and verified as best as possible.
But no system is perfect or without errors. Car manufacturers’ part numbers and applications guides
contain mistakes of their own. Therefore, we cannot guarantee or warranty that the part we show for a
particular vehicle is the absolute right one.

(PIN Codes for Infiniti & Nissan: =

When Nissan (and Infiniti) first introduced transponder keys in the U.S., they did not require a PIN Code for key
programming. Nissan then introduced a PIN Code for key programming and it is a static number for all models that were
included and it is "5523".

in 2003, Nissan then came up with a new system where you have to get the serial number from the BCM (Body Control
Module) and have it converted to a PIN Code that you could use for key programming. tis different in every car. The
BCM Serial number is 5 digits long with numbers and possible letters too. The PIN Code that is converted is always 4
numbers. It was not on every 2003 model, just a few.

In 2009, Nissan made a change to their existing system from 2003, by introducing a new algorithm (they changed the
math) and now Nissan had a New and Old system based on the year and the model.

In 2013, Nissan introduced another new PIN Code system that was 20 digits long. You have to enter all 20 digits, letters

& numbers, with all the letters being capitalized. It returns you with a response code that is also 20 digits long. This new
20 digit system changes every time you go to program keys, you cannot reuse the same code. It was not introduced on :
every 2013 model, just afew. :

In 2018, Nissan introduced another new PIN Code system that is 22 digits long. First seen overseas and now on selected
models in the U.S. The new 22 digit system is not on every model.

The good news is most newer key programmers can read the BCM code from the vehicle and convert it to a PIN Code
that can be used to program keys. So the systems that were introduced in 2003 & 2009 are not much of a problem
anymore.

A clever person figured out that there is a way for a key programmer to bypass the PIN Code requirement altogether on
the newer 20 digit system that was introduced in 2013.

So now we are left with the 22 digit system introduced in 2018. Dealer response code & dealer tool required at this time.
