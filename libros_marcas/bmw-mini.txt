DISCLAIMER: :

A wide variety of key programmers have been added to this book. Most key programmer companies are
not based in the U.S. Some of their application charts have many mistakes. In some cases, you will need
to check with your key programmer supplier to see if the vehicle you are working on is supported by their
tool. There is always a risk in damaging the vehicle electronics when you connect to the vehicle through
the OBD port if you are not using an OEM diagnostic tool. You as the locksmith take on this risk every
time you perform work on a vehicle.

If you have any doubt about what part to use, make sure you check with the dealer and have them run

_ the VIN to get you the right part number. Remember, ultimately it is your responsibility to obtain the

correct part. Part numbers and FCC information has been researched and verified as best as possible.
But no system is perfect or without errors. Car manufacturers’ part numbers and applications guides
contain mistakes of their own. Therefore, we cannot guarantee or warranty that the part we show for a
particular vehicle is the absolute right one.

Remove the trunk lock and disassemble, but remember when you take it apart that there is either one or two ball
bearings under spring pressure; one might be located in the tailpiece cam assembly and one should be in the plug.
The trunk lock will contain tumblers in positions 1 through 4, Left & Right. When you have done this, the key should
start the car. The tumblers in the second to last chamber of the factory ignition, 5 left & right are made so that any

key will operate them. They are not needed to make an ignition key. If you make a key by this method, the key will not
operate the alarm or deadlocks since cuts in position 5 & 6, left & right are missing and it can be difficult to impression
the doors because of the construction. : :

Method #3

You must remove the door panel and then remove the door cylinder/handle assembly. It is a little tricky, the whole
handle assembly and power door lock motor has to come out of the car to get to the cylinder. The cylinder contains
all 12 tumblers needed to make the master key.

First remove door panel. On top of the door cylinder/handle assembly is a slide that holds the front handle face plate
on. Pull the slide towards the edge of the door, you should be able to access this from inside the door or through an
access hole on the edge of the door. When the slide is pulled the front face plate can be removed. Next you will see

a large threaded ring encircling the cylinder on the front of the door; unscrew and remove the ring. At the opposite
side of the handle, you will see machine screw that goes all the way through. There is a nut on it. In side the door that
must be removed before the screw will come out the front.

Next, un-clip the electrical connections and remove the assembly. It may be necessary to move the window track a
little bit. To-do this, there is usually a hidden screw under the rubber on the window track itself towards the bottom of
the track. With the assembly out, before you disassemble to decode the cylinder, you should mark everything as to
where it goes for reassembly. The tumblers are numbered. There are 6 chambers that hold 12 tumblers.

There are 6 chambers that hold 12 tumblers. Left tumblers are numbered 11 through 14 and Right tumblers

WASTER > Mike's Tip: Transponder System is Standard - Dealer Closed System. Test key is HU92R

KEYS => | > There are many aftermarket solutions for BMW key programming. Some cars can be programmed through
: the OBD port and some require Eeprom programming. Abritus, VVDI and Zedfull seem to work well but are not
cheap and do not fully support every model. Many older model BMWs can be programmed using the AK90.

Some models can be read through the Eeprom for key programming when there is no easier alternative. This
usually requires a piece of hardware such as AK90, AR32, HRT, Orange5, SMOK or TMPro. The second part to
this is that you will need software to interpret the data “read” from the Eeprom. Such software tools that can
be used may or may not be included with the Eeprom hardware or cloners - are AR32, Tango, IKeyClone, HRT,
MiraClone or TMPro. = oo =

> There are many aftermarket solutions for BMW key programming. Some cars can be programmed through
the OBD port and some require Eeprom programming, Abritus, VVDI and Zedfull seem to work well but are not
cheap and do not fully support every model. Many older model BMWs can be programmed using the AK90.

Some models can be read through the Eeprom for key programming when there is no easier alternative. This
usually requires a piece of hardware such as AK90, AR32, HRT, Orange5, SMOK or TMPro. The second part to

this is that you will need software to interpret the data “read” from the Eeprom. Such software tools that can
be used may or may not be included with the Eeprom hardware or cloners - are AR32, Tango, |KeyClone, HRT,

Method #1

Use a Lock Reader / Decoder tool to decode the locks.

"Method #2

Remove the trunk lock and disassemble, but remember when you take it apart that there is either one or two ball
bearings under spring pressure; one might be located in the tailpiece cam assembly and one should be in the plug.
The trunk lock will contain tumblers in positions 1 through 4, Left & Right. When you have done this, the key should
start the car. The tumblers in the second to last chamber of the factory ignition, 5 left & right are made so that any

key will operate them. They are not needed to make an ignition key. if you make a key by this method, the key will not
operate the alarm or deadlocks since cuts in position 5 & 6, left & right are missing and it can be difficult to impression

the doors because of the construction.

Method #3

You must remove the door i bank and than remove the door cylinder/ handle assembly. It is a little Hick, the whole
handle assembly and power door lock motor has to come out of the « car to get to the cylinder. The oo contains
all 12 tumblers needed to make the master key. : =

First remove door panel. On top of the door cylinder/handle assembly is a slide that holds the front handle face plate —

on. Pull the slide towards the edge of the door, you should be able to access this from inside the door or through an
access hole on the edge of the door. When the slide is pulled the front face plate can be removed. Next you will see

a large threaded ring encircling the cylinder on the front of the door; unscrew and remove the ring. At the opposite —
side of the handle, you will see machine screw that goes all the way through. There is a nut on it. In side the door that
must be removed before the screw will come out the erent

Next, un-clip the electrical eonrections and remove othe assembly. It may aor necessary to move the window track a
little bit. To do this, there is usually a hidden screw under the rubber on the window track itself towards the bottom of
the track. With the assembly out, before you disassemble to decode the cylinder, you should mark everything as to
where it goes for reassembly. The tumblers are numbered. ‘There are 6 chambers that hold 12 tumblers. :

There are 6 chambers that hold 12 tumblers. Left tumblers are numbered 11 through 14 and Right tumblers

Method #1 Remove a door cylinder or trunk cylinder and read the code on it and make a key by code, using space and
depth keys. Must have a High Security key machine. The codes have been published and may contain many
different prefixes but the series runs from 0001-1100. These are dimple keys.
Method #2 The ignition cylinder is only held in by a metal spring clip similar to VW:s, It should have a code stamped on

it. Make a key by code or replace the cylinder.
