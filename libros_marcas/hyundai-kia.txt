HYUNDAI = KIA

DISCLAIMER:

A wide variety of key programmers have been added to this book. Most key programmer companies are

not based in the U.S. Some of their application charts have many mistakes. In some cases, you will need
to check with your key programmer supplier to see if the vehicle you are working on is supported by their
tool. There is always a risk in damaging the vehicle electronics when you connect to the vehicle through
the OBD port if you are not using an OEM diagnostic tool. You as the locksmith take on this risk every

| time you perform work on a vehicle.

if you have any doubt about what part to use, make sure you check with the dealer and have them run

the VIN to get you the right part number. Remember, ultimately it is your responsibility to obtain the
correct part. Part numbers and FCC information has been researched and verified as best as possible. |
But no system is perfect or without errors. Car manufacturers’ part numbers and applications guides
contain mistakes of their own. Therefore, we cannot guarantee or warranty that the part we show fora |
particular vehicle is the absolute right one.

1) To make sure you get the right part - always have the VIN run through the dealer for the correct parts application.

2) Hyundai & Kia use several code series that are similar or the same as others. The confusion comes.into play when you have a code series
that has both an 8-cut version and @10-cut version. This is made more confusing because they can use the same blank too. Depending on the —
code software and key cutting equipment you have - not all variations may be listed in your code software. | have researched many possibilities
and have updated the Application: Guide to take into account these variations. However, there may still be the possibility for more variations, An
example would be - where a car is 10-cut but only the 8-cut series shows up in your software.

Usually you can add ‘as your first 2 cuts and then use the remaining 8 cuts from the keycode for a complete 10-cut key, however this not bee :
the case. We always recommend using InstaCode software. InstaCode has the most accurate and complete ist of automotive a oy lg in

the world. tt may cost more, but what is your time worth?

IMPORTANT NOTES:

1) Always check the trunk lock for ease of removal. Since Hyundai & Kia do not have codes on their
locks it may be easier to remove the trunk lock and decode the tumblers in the lock.

2) Some door cylinders have a clutch type lock cylinder, the trunk does not.

3) The Door & Trunk cylinders all use split tumblers with numbers on them.

4) Some Door & Trunk cylinders have drill guards in the cylinder plugs.

Method #1 Check owner's manual for codes, written in by the dealer.
Method #2 Use a Lock Decoder/Reader tool to decode the door lock.

Method #3 Disassemble Door or Trunk cylinder and decode wafers to make master key.

_IMPORTANT NOTES: =
1) Always check the trunk lock for ease of removal. Since Hyundai & Kia do not have codes on their
locks it may be easier to remove the trunk lock and decode the tumblers in the lock.
2) Some door cylinders have a clutch type lock cylinder, the trunk does not.
3) The Door & Trunk cylinders all use split tumblers with numbers on them.
4) Some Door & Trunk cylinders have drill guards in the cylinder plugs. _

Method #1 Check owner's manual for codes, written in by the dealer.
Method #2 —_ Use a Lock Decoder/Reader tool to decode the door lock.

Method #3__—Disassemble Door or Trunk cylinder and decode wafers to make master key.

Facts to remember:

1. All tumblers are numbered, but are reverse of normal depths, a number 5 is a shallow cut and a number | depth is the deepest

cut.

2, Tumbler position 8R is always a number 4 depth for the master key, and a number 2 depth for a valet key.
This is the only different between a master and a valet key.

3. Tumblers 4L, 3L, 2L, 1L, and 8L are not used in any locks, but must follow MACS. (So the key works smoothly)

4, Because of the tolerances of the center groove you can not have a number 5 depth on the left track opposite a number 4 or 5
depth. There wouldn't be enough room for the key to pass down in the keyway of the lock (and vice-versa).

5. There is never a number 1 depth in the 5th, 6th, 7th, or 8th position from the bow, if there is one at all. Either Left or Right.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
1) Always check the trunk lock for ease of removal. Since Hyundai & Kia do not have codes on their
locks it may be easier to remove the trunk lock and decode the tumblers in the lock.

2) Some door cylinders have a clutch type lock cylinder, the trunk does not.
3) The Door & Trunk cylinders all use split tumblers with numbers on them.
4) Some Door & Trunk cylinders have drill guards in the cylinder plugs.

Method #1 Check owner's manual for codes, written in by the dealer.
Method #2 Use-a-Lock Decoder/Reader tool to decode the door lock.

Method #3 Disassemble Door or Trunk cylinder and decode wafers to make master key.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

1) Always check the trunk lock for ease of removal. Since Hyundai & Kia do not have codes on their

locks it may be easier to remove the trunk lock and decode the tumblers in the lock.

2) Some door cylinders have a clutch type lock cylinder, the trunk does not.

3) The Door & Trunk cylinders all use split tumblers with numbers on them.

4) Some Door & Trunk cylinders have drill guards in the cylinder plugs.

Method #1 Check owner's manual for codes, written in by the dealer.

Method #2 Use a Lock Decoder/Reader tool to decode the door lock.

Method #3 Disassemble Door or Trunk cylinder and decode wafers to make master key.
