__DISCLAIMER: :

| Awide variety of key programmers have been added to this book. Most key programmer companies are

| not based in the U.S. Some of their application charts have many mistakes. In some cases, you will need
to check with your key programmer supplier to see if the vehicle you are working on is supported by their
| tool. There is always a risk in damaging the vehicle electronics when you connect to the vehicle through

__ the OBD port if you are not using an OEM diagnostic tool. You as the locksmith take on this risk every

| time you perform work on a vehicle.

If you have any doubt about what part to use, make sure you check with the dealer and have them run
the VIN to get you the right part number. Remember, ultimately it is your responsibility to obtain the
correct part. Part numbers and FCC information has been researched and verified as best as possible.
But no system is perfect or without errors. Car manufacturers’ part numbers and applications guides
contain mistakes of their own. Therefore, we cannot guarantee or warranty that the part we show for a
particular vehicle is the absolute right one.

cutting fluid to better ease the cutter along. The process of cutting the key heats up the aluminum to a point
where the aluminum will bind with the cutter and ruin it. | use A-9 Aluminum Cutting Fluid, one oat on the tip
and 1 drop on the center of the cutting area of the blade.

NOTES: 7
You will need to have a machine that can code cut 8 wafer Tibbe keys, not all machines do. Silca makes such a machine or you
can buy an adapter to use on an HPC 1200 Code Machine. Framon also makes an adapter for their #2 Code Machine.

Remove door panel, usually this is a two piece panel, remove door handle/lock assembly. Do not take components apart.
Turn handle/lock assembly so you can look through the cylinder cavity drain hole, where the tumblers are. There are eight
tumblers and three depths (angles). You may only be able to see tumblers two through eight, progression number one tumbler.

a re >

The tumblers with one notch in it, is a number one depth.
The tumblers with two notches in it, is a number two depth.
The tumblers with no notch in it, is a number three depth.

You should now be able to make a master key for all locks on the car.

? Note: Check to see if your key programmer supports your vehicle.

Codes: | No codes on any locks.

NOTES: You will need to have a machine that can code cut Tibbe keys. Silca makes such a machine or you can buy
: an adapter to use on an HPC 1200 Code Machine. Framon also makes an adapter for their #2 Code
Machine. —
Method 1: There are several 6-cut Tibbe lock picks & decoders on the market that can accurately read the lock.
Method 2: Remove the door lock and look through the drain hole to read the notch’s on them for the depth’s.

1 notch is a #1 Depth/Angle, 2 notch’s is a #2 Depth/Angle, 3 notch’s is a #3 Depth/Angle
& No notch is a #4 Depth/Angle.

For models that do not have notch’s on the tumblers when you look through the drain hole - you will to
disassemble the lock to read the depth (angle) number stamped on the side of the tumbler. The tumblers
have no notches on them,

cutting fluid to better ease the cutter along. The process of cutting the key heats up the aluminum to a point

Remove door panel, usually this is a two piece panel, remove door handle/lock assembly. Do not take components apart.
Turn handle/lock assembly so you can look through the cylinder cavity drain hole, where the tumblers are. There are eight
tumblers and three depths (angles). You may only be able to see tumblers two through eight, progression number one tumbler.

The tumblers with one notch in it, is a number one depth.

The tumblers with two notches in it, is a number two depth.

_ The tumblers with no notch in it, is a number three depth.

You should now be able to make a master key for all locks on the car.
