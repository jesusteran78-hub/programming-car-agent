DISCLAIMER:

A wide variety of key programmers have been added to this book. Most key programmer companies are
not based in the U.S. Some of their application charts have many mistakes. In some cases, you will need
to check with your key programmer supplier to see if the vehicle you are working on is supported by their
tool. There is always a risk in damaging the vehicle electronics when you connect to the vehicle through
the OBD port if you are not using an OEM diagnostic tool. You as the locksmith take on this risk every
time you perform work on a vehicle.

If you have any doubt about what part to-use, make sure you check with the dealer and have them run
the VIN to get you the right part number. Remember, ultimately it is your responsibility to obtain the
correct part. Part numbers and FCC information has been researched and verified as best as possible.
But no system is perfect or without errors. Car manufacturers’ part numbers and applications guides
contain mistakes of their own. Therefore, we cannot guarantee or warranty that the part we show for a
particular vehicle is the absolute right one. :

Method #1 Use a Lock Decoder/Reader tool to decode the door lock.
Method #2 Remove door cylinder and disassemble. The tumblers have a number stamped on them. Make a

key to the door cylinder and it will work all the other locks. There are Four Depths. Do not follow
_ the 'U &'R’ stamped on the tumblers. The positions of the tumblers in comparison to left and right
are staggered on the key. Earlier Volvo 4-Track keys are not like that, but are evenly spaced.

Method #i — Remove and disassemble glove box to get cuts in positions 2L, 2R, 3L, 3R. Progression cuts in

positions 1L, 1R in the door lock. Next progression cuts 4L, 4R in the ignition for a complete key.

Method #2 Remove door cylinder and disassemble. The tumblers i in these locks z are like no others. They sort of
look like an interlocking ‘H: The tumblers have a depth number casted into them. The door cylinder
will have tumblers 1, 2, & 3 left & right. Male a sid key to door sylinders and progression the

will always be the Right-hand cut in the key. :

Method #1 Use a Lock Decoder/ Reader tool to decode the door lock.
Method #2 Remove door cylinder and disassemble. The tumblers have a number stamped on them. Make a

key to the door cylinder and it will work all the other locks. There are Four Depths. Do not follow
‘R' stamped on the tumblers. The positions of the tumblers in comparison to left and right
are staggered on the key, Earlier Volvo 4-Track keys are not like that, but are evenly spaced.
