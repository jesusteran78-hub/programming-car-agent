> Mike's Tip: Transponder System or Proximity System i is standard equipment ‘Test Key is HU64-P

> There are many aftermarket solutions for Mercedes key programming. Some cars can be cage
through the OBD port and some require Eeprom programming. Abrites, VVDI and Zedfull seem to work well but
are not cheap and do not fully support every model. My personal recommendation is Abrites for Mercedes.

More Mercedes uses an Infrared Transponder system with Fobik’s. Proximity systems will require the dealer equipment
Info=> —_| for programming. : :

Some models can be read through the Eeprom for key programming when there is no easier alternative. This
usually requires a piece of hardware such as AK500, AR32, HRT, Orange5, SMOK or TMPro. The second part to
this is that you will need software to interpret the data “read” from the Eeprom. Such software tools that can
be used may or may not be included with the =: hardware or cloners - are AR32, Tango, es HRT,
MiraClone or TMPro.

There are many variations to mercedes cars, Mercedes made for the north American market are more predictable than cars made for
other markets. Mercedes made for other markets have been given the name “grey market’ or “European models cars: :

It is necessary to determine which chassis number the car you're going to make a key to is. Once you have determined the chassis _

Method: 1 - Use Lishi to try and determine door cuts without removing the door lock. Cg from there, outlined on next
page.

Method: 2 - It will be necessary to remove the door panel. We suggest removing the passenger side as this lock is the less worn
of the two, Mercedes door panels have few screws attaching the panel to the door. The screws it does have are usually hidden.
The panels have plastic hooks in them that lock into the door’s sheet metal to hold the panel in place. The panel must be lifted up
to remove, and do not lift outward, like standard panels. There is usually a hidden ten-millimeter bolt behind the top portion of the
arm rest/door pull. The bolt can be seen after gently snapping out the seat control face plate and then getting behind the inside
door release handle face plate. Unplug the panel light, to avoid breaking the wires attached to it.

Once you have the panel off, there will be 3 or 4 screws holding the latch assembly in place. These screws will use anumber 3
Phillips head. Remove these screws. Remove the retaining screw on the edge of the door that holds the key cylinder in place,

it may be behind a black plastic plug. Remove the larger black plastic plug that contains the alarm connector and unsnap the
connector. The long tailpiece on the end of the key cylinder will have a “wing tip’ to it. The wing tip operates inside the latch
assembly, and can only be removed by rotating the key in the lock cylinder and gently pulling outward, Since you do not have a
key it will be necessary to gently pull out the key cylinder as far as it will go and then gently rotate the latch aay It may work
better to have the latch in the locked position or in be = { position.

Once again, you are trying to rotate the latch assembly in one direction while rotating the key cylinder in the other direction
while gently pulling outward on the key cylinder. Be careful of the alarm connector wire. The part in the latch assembly that the
key cylinder operates in is made of plastic, so you should keep this in mind at all times.

Once you have the key cylinder out you will need to disassemble it until you can go no further. Be sure to mark all the pieces
you take apart. You should be left with a plug and an inner housing. Prep a key with all number 5 cuts, You should be able

to look down the tumbler chambers. insert the prepped key and use four small pieces of metal to reach down in the tumbler
chambers to bring the tumblers to the shear line in order to turn the plug for removal. Be patient as it may take some time to get
all tumblers to the shear line so the plug will turn. After you have removed the plug you can then decode the wafers to make a
working key to the doors. The tumblers will be stamped with a depth number.

THERE ARE MANY VARIATIONS TO MERCEDES TUMBLERS DEPTH STAMPING:
Some Right full tumblers are stamped 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Some are not.
Some Left full tumblers are stamped 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. Some are not.
Usually all tumblers are stamped with at least a depth number. If there are two numbers stamped onthe ae

Once you have made a working key to the doors, then progression cut position number 5R in the glove box. The ie box is all
plastic, so do not force the key. Either it works ee or it doesn't.

Once you have made a working key to the doors and glove box, then progression cut position 7R in the trunk.

Once you have made a working key to the doors, glove box and trunk, then progression cut position number 6R in the ignition.
_ Once you have a working key to the ignition, it will be the master key.

On a 4-Track, non-factory alarm model, the key you make to the door lock should also work the trunk and glove box. There will

be three missing cuts needed to make an ignition key. Those positions are 2L, 3L, and 6R. You will need to impression them

in the ignition or progression the cuts. If you impression the missing cuts, remember to not force the key as there are tumblers

the car. The tumblers will be stamped with a depth number. —

S Replace the door cylinder with a new from the dealer, part number #202-760-12-77. The part costs about $31, Now you can cut the
face off, of the original lock. Remove plug and decode the wafers to make complete key. Use the tumblers from the original lock to

recode the new part before you install it. The tumblers will be stamped with a depth number.

All the tumblers needed to make a complete key can be found in the door cylinder.

Method:

It will be necessary to remove the door panel. We suggest removing the passenger side as this lock is the less worn of the two.
Mercedes door panels have few screws attaching the panel to the door. The screws it does have are usually hidden. The panels
have plastic hooks in them that lock into the door's sheet metal to hold the panel in place. The Pa must be lifted up to poe
and do not lift outward, like standard panels.

There is usually a hidden 10-millimeter bolt behind the top portion of the arm rest/door pull. The bolt can be seen after gently
snapping out the seat control faceplate and then getting behind the inside door release handle faceplate. :

Once you have the panel off, there will be 3 or 4 screws holding the latch assembly in place. These: screws will use. a number 3
Phillips head, Remove these screws, Remove the retaining screw on the edge of the door that holds the key cylinder in place, it may
be behind a black plastic plug. Remove the larger black plastic plug that contains the alarm connector and unsnap the connector.
The long tailpiece on the end of the key cylinder will have a “wing tip’ to it. The wing top operates inside the latch assembly, and
can only be removed by rotating the key in the lock cylinder and gently pulling outward. Since you do not have a key, it will be
necessary to gently pull out the key cylinder as far as it will go, and then gently rotate the latch assembly. It may work better to
have the latch in the locked position or in the unlocked position.

Once again, you are trying to rotate the latch assembly in == direction while rotating the key cylinder in the other direction while
gently pulling outward on the key cylinder. Be careful of the alarm connector wire. The part in the latch assembly that the key
cylinder operates in is made of plastic, so you should keep this in mind at all times. continued on next page...

Once you have the key she out you will need to disassemble it until you can go no further. Be sure to mark all pieces you take -
apart. You should be left with a plug and housing.

The housing to the lock does not expose the tumbler chambers, as in other High Security models. The plug does need to rotate to
be removed. There are three possible ways to do this. We recommend choice ‘3.

1. Drill a 1/8” hole into the slope of the tumbler chamber on each side of the housing, on the tailpiece end of the housing. You must
be careful not to drill too far and hit the plug. Prep a key with all number 5 cuts. Insert the prepped key and use two small pieces
of metal to reach down in the tumbler chambers to bring the tumblers to the shear line in order to turn the plug for removal. Be
patient as this may take some time to get all tumblers to the shear line so the plug will turn. After you have removed the plug you
can then decode the wafers to make a working key to the doors. The tumblers will be stamped with a depth number.

All the tumblers needed to make a complete key can be found in the door cylinder.

2, Use a Dremel to cut a groove down the tumbler chamber on each side of the housing. You must be careful not to cut too far and
hit the plug. Prep a key with all number 5 cuts. insert the prepped key and use two small pieces of metal to hold down the
tumblers to bring the tumblers to the shear line in order to turn the plug for removal. Be patient as this may take some time to get
all tumblers to the shear line so the plug will turn. After you have removed the plug you can then decode the wafers to make a
complete key to the car. The tumblers will be stamped with a depth number.

Allthe tumblers needed to make a complete key can be found in the door cylinder. _

3, Replace the door cylinder with ASP part # D-21-103 or D-21-104. The part costs about $40. Now you can cut the face off of the
original lock. Remove the plug and decode the wafers to make complete key. Use the tumblers from the original lock to recode
the new part before you install it. The tumblers will be stamped with a depth number.

All the tumblers needed to make a complete key can be found in the door cylinder.

Once you have the key cylinder out you will need to disassemble it unti you can go no further. Be sure to mark all pieces you take
apart. You should be left with a plug and an inner housing. Prep a key with all number 5 cuts. You should be able to look down the
tumbler chambers. Insert the prepped key and use two small pieces of metal to reach down in the tumbler chambers to bring the

There should only be one missing tumbler, as the door lock contained tumblers 2 through 13.
